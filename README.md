AI Lab Project(s)

HDFC Bank Ltd. aims to improve its loan processing efficiency by predicting whether a loan application should be approved or rejected based on applicant details. Using a dataset containing information such as applicant income, loan amount, credit history, employment status, property area, and other financial indicators, develop a supervised machine learning classification model to categorize applications as Approved or Rejected.

Amazon Supply Chain Intelligence, an AI-driven division of Amazon, aims to predict delivery delay risk levels for e-commerce orders to improve customer satisfaction. Using datasets containing order volume, warehouse processing time, shipment distance, traffic conditions, weather indicators, and historical delivery performance, develop a Python-based machine learning multi-class classification model to categorize deliveries as On-Time, At Risk, or Delayed. The project should include advanced data pre-processing, feature engineering, handling class imbalance, and comparative evaluation of multiple classification algorithms using suitable performance metrics.
